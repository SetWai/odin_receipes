        <li>1 ½ lb chicken breast(750 g), cubed</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups cremini mushroom(150 g)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth(960 mL)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream(240 mL)</li>
        <li>1 lb farfalle pasta(500 g)</li>
        <li>5 oz spinach(150 g)</li>
        <li>1 cup parmesan cheese(110 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper, and brown - make sure to cook through. Set chicken aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth and heavy cream to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the farfalle pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from clumping together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.)</li>
        <li>When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down and incorporates.</li>
        <li>Add parmesan and stir until it’s well-incorporated and you’re left with a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Top off with extra parmesan and serve.</li>
    </ol>
